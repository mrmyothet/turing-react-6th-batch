/*
Category consists 3 mathematical entities  
1. objects 
  string, int, etc 
  input, output 

Morphism 
  function -> pure function 

2. Associativity 
1+2+3
(1+2)+3 = 1+(2+3)
f(g x ) = (f g)(x)

3. Identity 
0+3 = 3
3+0 = 3 
0 is Identity for add operation 

Algebraic Data Types (ADT) 
Algebra - mathematic operations -> add substract multiply division 

can compose - composite types 

data Tree = Empty 
            | Leaf Int
            | Node Int Tree Tree 

composite of 3 data structures
